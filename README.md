   - PostgreSQL will be installed automatically by the setup script

2. **Setup**
   - Open Terminal
   - Navigate to project directory:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/Fashion-Catalog-SoftwareDesign
     ```
   - Make setup script executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x setup.sh
     ```
   - Run setup script:
     ```bash
     ./setup.sh
     ```
   - **Note**: Admin credentials will be displayed in the terminal when the application starts

## üìå Accessing the Application

After successful setup:
- Web Application: http://localhost:8000
- Admin GUI: Opens automatically in a separate window
- **Important**: Check the terminal for admin login credentials

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PostgreSQL Connection Issues**
   - Windows:
     - Verify PostgreSQL is running
     - Check port 5432 is not in use
     - Confirm password is "postgres"
   - macOS:
     - Run `brew services start postgresql@14`
     - Check status with `brew services list`

2. **Python/Pip Issues**
   - Verify Python installation:
     ```bash
     python --version  # Windows
     python3 --version # macOS
     ```
   - Check PATH settings

3. **Application Not Starting**
   - Check if all dependencies are installed
   - Verify database connection in .env file
   - Ensure port 8000 is available
   - Make sure to check the terminal for any error messages

4. **Admin GUI Not Opening**
